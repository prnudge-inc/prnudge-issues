# PRNudge Terms of Service (Beta)

_Last updated: 2026-02-04

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the **PRNudge** GitHub App (the "Service"). By installing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. The Service

PRNudge helps teams reduce time-to-first-review by:
- Posting reminder comments ("nudges") on pull requests that have not been reviewed within a threshold.
- Creating a weekly report issue per enabled repository.

## 2. Beta status

The Service is currently offered as a **beta**.
- Features may change, break, or be removed.
- You understand beta software may contain errors and may not be continuously available.

## 3. Accounts and permissions

You authorize PRNudge to access repositories you select via GitHub installation settings, using the permissions and webhooks you approve during installation.

You are responsible for:
- Ensuring you have rights to install apps in your organization/repositories.
- Managing repository access and installation scope.

## 4. Acceptable use

You agree not to:
- Abuse the Service (e.g., attempting to overload endpoints, bypass auth, or exploit bugs).
- Use the Service to harass, threaten, or spam others.
- Use the Service in violation of applicable laws or GitHub policies.

We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe you are violating these Terms.

## 5. Availability and support

We aim to keep the Service running, but we do not guarantee uptime, delivery times, or that nudges/reports will always be produced on schedule. Scheduled jobs may be delayed by GitHub Actions scheduling.

Support: open an issue in the public support repository or email **support@prnudge.com**.

## 6. Fees

During beta, the Service may be offered free of charge. We may introduce pricing in the future with notice.

## 7. Intellectual property

We retain all rights in the Service, including software, branding, and documentation. You retain rights in your repositories and content.

## 8. Data and privacy

Our Privacy Policy describes how we process data:

## 9. Disclaimer of warranties

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 10. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED USD $100 (OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 3 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT, IF ANY), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

## 11. Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time by uninstalling the GitHub App.

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time, especially for security, abuse prevention, or legal compliance.

## 12. Changes to these Terms
